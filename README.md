Model Equation:
Chance of Admit = -1.5810856 + 0.0024593 * GRE + 0.0033339 * TOEFL + 0.1335526 * CGPA + 0.0221002 * Research

Coefficients:

Intercept: The intercept is -1.5810856.
GRE: The coefficient for GRE is 0.0024593, indicating that for a one-unit increase in GRE, the chance of admission increases by this amount.
TOEFL: The coefficient for TOEFL is 0.0033339, suggesting a similar interpretation as GRE.
CGPA: The coefficient for CGPA is 0.1335526, implying that a one-unit increase in CGPA is associated with a 0.1335526 increase in the chance of admission.
Research: The coefficient for Research is 0.0221002, suggesting that having research experience increases the chance of admission by this amount.
Significance Levels:

The significance levels are denoted by the p-values.
Variables with p-values less than 0.05 (indicated by **, *, or .) are considered statistically significant.
In this model, Intercept, GRE, CGPA are statistically significant, while TOEFL and Research have p-values close to the significance level.
Model Fit:

Residual standard error: It measures the average amount that the predicted values differ from the actual values. In this case, it is 0.07444.
Multiple R-squared: It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Chance of Admit) that is predictable from the independent variables (GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, Research). Here, it is 0.7542, indicating a good fit.
Adjusted R-squared: It adjusts the R-squared for the number of predictors in the model. It is 0.7501.
F-statistic and p-value: These assess the overall significance of the model. A low p-value (< 0.05) suggests that at least one variable is significant in predicting the dependent variable.

In summary, the model suggests that GRE, CGPA, and having research experience are statistically significant predictors of the chance of admission. The model also has a good overall fit based on R-squared and F-statistic.
