Linear regression model equation: 

Chance of Admit = -1.5810856 + 0.0024593 * GRE + 0.0033339 * TOEFL + 0.1335526 * CGPA + 0.0221002 * Research

Coefficients:

•	Intercept: The intercept is -1.5810856. 
•	GRE: The coefficient for GRE is 0.0024593, indicating that for a one-unit increase in GRE, the chance of admission increases by this amount. 
•	TOEFL: The coefficient for TOEFL is 0.0033339, suggesting a similar interpretation as GRE. 
•	CGPA: The coefficient for CGPA is 0.1335526, implying that a one-unit increase in CGPA is associated with a 0.1335526 increase in the chance of admission. 
•	Research: The coefficient for Research is 0.0221002, suggesting that having research experience increases the chance of admission by this amount. 
•	Significance Levels: The significance levels are denoted by the p-values. Variables with p-values less than 0.05 (indicated by **, *, or .) are considered statistically significant. In this model, Intercept, GRE, CGPA are statistically significant, while TOEFL and Research have p-values close to the significance level. Model Fit:
•	Residual standard error: It measures the average amount that the predicted values differ from the actual values. In this case, it is 0.07444. 
•	Multiple R-squared: It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Chance of Admit) that is predictable from the independent variables (GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, Research). Here, it is 0.7542, indicating a good fit. 
•	Adjusted R-squared: It adjusts the R-squared for the number of predictors in the model. It is 0.7501. 
•	F-statistic and p-value: These assess the overall significance of the model. A low p-value (< 0.05) suggests that at least one variable is significant in predicting the dependent variable.

In summary, the model suggests that GRE, CGPA, and having research experience are statistically significant predictors of the chance of admission. The model also has a good overall fit based on R-squared and F-statistic.

Random Forest regression model:

•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.0037365241404424
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.0481440679825876
•	R-squared: 0.783351540031707
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.0611271146091683

Now, let's interpret these metrics:

•	MSE: The MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower MSE is better, and in this case, the value is relatively low, indicating that the model's predictions are generally close to the actual values.
•	MAE: The MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower MAE is desirable, and the value here is relatively small, suggesting that, on average, the model's predictions are close to the actual values.
•	R-squared: R-squared is a measure of how well the model explains the variability in the dependent variable. A higher R-squared (closer to 1) indicates a better fit. In your case, an R-squared of 0.78 suggests that the model explains about 78% of the variance in the Chance of Admit.
•	RMSE: The RMSE is the square root of the MSE and provides a measure of the average magnitude of errors. A lower RMSE is better, and here the value is relatively small, indicating that the model's predictions are, on average, close to the actual values.
