Linear regression model equation: 

Chance of Admit = -1.5810856 + 0.0024593 * GRE + 0.0033339 * TOEFL + 0.1335526 * CGPA + 0.0221002 * Research

Coefficients:

•	Intercept: The intercept is -1.5810856. 
•	GRE: The coefficient for GRE is 0.0024593, indicating that for a one-unit increase in GRE, the chance of admission increases by this amount. 
•	TOEFL: The coefficient for TOEFL is 0.0033339, suggesting a similar interpretation as GRE. 
•	CGPA: The coefficient for CGPA is 0.1335526, implying that a one-unit increase in CGPA is associated with a 0.1335526 increase in the chance of admission. 
•	Research: The coefficient for Research is 0.0221002, suggesting that having research experience increases the chance of admission by this amount. 
•	Significance Levels: The significance levels are denoted by the p-values. Variables with p-values less than 0.05 (indicated by **, *, or .) are considered statistically significant. In this model, Intercept, GRE, CGPA are statistically significant, while TOEFL and Research have p-values close to the significance level. Model Fit:
•	Residual standard error: It measures the average amount that the predicted values differ from the actual values. In this case, it is 0.07444. 
•	Multiple R-squared: It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Chance of Admit) that is predictable from the independent variables (GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, Research). Here, it is 0.7542, indicating a good fit. 
•	Adjusted R-squared: It adjusts the R-squared for the number of predictors in the model. It is 0.7501. 
•	F-statistic and p-value: These assess the overall significance of the model. A low p-value (< 0.05) suggests that at least one variable is significant in predicting the dependent variable.

In summary, the model suggests that GRE, CGPA, and having research experience are statistically significant predictors of the chance of admission. The model also has a good overall fit based on R-squared and F-statistic.

Random Forest regression model:

MSE: 0.0035
Lower MSE values are desirable, and in this case, a MSE of 0.0035 suggests that, on average, the squared difference between the predicted and actual Chance of Admit values is relatively small. This indicates good predictive accuracy.

MAE: 0.0455
The MAE measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. An MAE of 0.0455 means, on average, the model's predictions deviate by approximately 0.0455 from the actual values. This value is relatively small, indicating good accuracy.

R-squared: 0.7971
R-squared is a measure of how well the model explains the variance in the target variable. An R-squared of 0.7971 indicates that about 79.71% of the variance in the Chance of Admit is explained by the model. This is a good R-squared value, suggesting that the model captures a substantial portion of the variability in the target variable.

RMSE: 0.0592
RMSE is the square root of the MSE and provides a measure of the average magnitude of errors. An RMSE of 0.0592 suggests that, on average, the model's predictions deviate by approximately 0.0592 from the actual values. This value is relatively small, indicating good accuracy.

In summary, based on the provided metrics, your Random Forest regression model seems to be performing well on the test dataset. The small values of MSE, MAE, and RMSE, along with the relatively high R-squared, suggest that the model provides accurate predictions for the Chance of Admit.
